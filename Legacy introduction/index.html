  <p>Hi, i would love to introduce my favourite mtg format to you - Legacy.
   In this article, i will assume you're already familiar with mtg, because legacy is usually 
   not the format people start with. If you are new to magic, i would recommend a different format,
   like standard or draft to start with and then come to Legacy later.

<h1 id="introduction" style="margin-block: 10px">Introduction</h1>
 <div class="container50">
    <div>Legacy is a format where every magic card, except cards on the <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/banned-restricted-list" target="_blank">
    ban list</a>, is legal. 
         The wide card pool gives you endless possibilities to build decks. What is even better, 
         powerful decks. You can win on turn 1 with a combo deck, or if you prefer slower decks, 
         you can even win on turn 15 with control. Even though Legacy has a lot of powerful cards,
         games still go long. Legacy was dominated by blue control and tempo decks for a long time, 
         because force of will, brainstorm and ponder give your deck so much consistency. With the 
         printing of Orcish Bowmasters and other powerful nonblue cards in the recent years, the
         format is becoming more balanced and every color has something to offer. <br>
         You will enjoy legacy if you like interactive games where your decisions matter, because
         that's how most of the legacy games play out. The format isn't easy to learn at first, but 
         rewards experience. If you like deckbuilding, you will also enjoy Legacy. There is a lot of
         room for brewing, the format is far from fixed and new cards coming out earlier than before 
         give you even more possibilities for brewing. <br>
         I believe legacy is the best magic format, but it has 2 big issues. First is, it's not a 
         competetive format. There is no Legacy pro tour or worlds, so if your goal is to play in these
         tournaments, you don't need to play any Legacy, it's better to focus on formats like standard, draft
         and modern. The second issue is card availabity. Dual lands are on the reserved list, so they are really
         expensive and a lot of people just can't afford them. Thankfully, lot of Legacy communities are friendly and 
         can borrow you the cards you don't have, or they allow proxies. Legacy is also much cheaper on mtgo, the average
         Legacy deck costs around the same as modern deck.

<h1 id="archetypes" style="margin: 10px auto">Decklists and archetypes</h1>
<div class="container50">
    <div><h2>tempo</h2>
    Tempo decks in Legacy are blue decks, with another 1 or 2 colors supporting it. They are based on playing cheap
    and efficent threats, protecting them and disrupting opponent's resources. There are 5 cards that you'll find in every
    tempo deck, usually as a playset -  Brainstorm, Ponder, Force of Will, Daze and Wasteland. Brainstorm and ponder help you
    find whatever you need for just 1 mana. Wasteland helps you to disrupt your opponent by destroying one of their lands and 
    you'll always find a target because every deck in legacy plays non basic lands. Daze, especially combined with wasteland,
    restricting their mana, is really powerful card. Tempo decks only need 2-3 lands to play all their cards, so picking up
    an island to your hand isn't a big drawback. <br> 
    Historically, tempo decks always played Delver of Secrets, because it was the most efficent threat for 1 mana. Nowadays, 
    there are a lot of new better threats, so Delver doesn't see as much play as before. Currently there are 3 tempo decks that 
    see a decent amount of play. <br>
    <a href="https://mtgtop8.com/event?e=48699&d=558842&f=LE" target="_blank">Grixis Delver</a> 
    This deck is the only tempo deck right now still playing delver of secrets. Dragon's rage channeler and Orcish bowmasters 
    are a lot better cheap threats so you need a good reason to play delver. Grixis is the fastest tempo deck, because it plays 
    8 creatures that you can play on turn 1. This is the classic tempo deck, deny opponents resources, protect your threats and win.
    <br> <a href="https://www.mtgtop8.com/event?e=48734&d=559096&f=LE" target="_blank">Dimir Scam</a>
    Dimir scam is a new Legacy deck that doesn't play any 1 mana creatures. That doesn't mean it can't win fast! 
    The core of the deck is Grief, Reanimate and Troll of khazad dum. Ideal start for the deck is grief, pitch black card
    and reanimate, so you start with a 3/2 menace creature on turn 1 and discard 2 cards from your opponents deck. Also, 
    Troll of khazad dum provides consistency and allows you to play lower land count, so you don't have as many dead draws in the
    lategame. Reanimating troll on turn 2 also happens quite often, and thanks to it's ability, it's basically unblockable. <br>
    <a href="https://www.mtgtop8.com/event?e=48483&d=557127&f=LE" target="_blank">Dimir Shadow</a>
    Shadow is similiar deck to scam, but instead of being based on grief, it plays 4 copies of Death's Shadow. You are looking to 
    reduce your life total to less than 13 and then kill your opponent with huge death's shadow. <br> 
    <br>
    Temur delver also sees a good amount of play right now, but it's winrate and meta % isn't as high as these 3 above.
    There are 2 versions, one with Up the Beanstalk and more delve threats, the other one with Questing Druid. Let's see how
    the temur decks perform, maybe they will also become real contenders in the metagame. <br>
    Tempo decks usually struggle against control decks like 4 color control with Uro, swords to plowshares and Carpet of Flowers 
    post sb. Fair green decks like cradle control and elves or land based decks like Depths and Lands are also quite good against
    tempo. A lot of decks that are good against it, but tempo punishes any not ideal draw hard. It can win a lot of games even 
    when it's not favored in the match up, Wasteland and Daze do a lot of work.

<div class="container50">
    <div><h2>Blue Control</h2>
Another Legacy archetype is control. Blue based control almost always plays blue and white and then other colors, sometimes 
even all 5. The general gameplan is to survive whatever your opponent does by playing a lot of reactive spells like swords to 
plowshares, counterspells and cantrips to find everything you need. Once you survive the early game, you overwhelm your opponent 
with your expensive high impact planeswalker and other spells. You can often find Narset, parter of veils, Teferi, time Raveler,
Minsc and boo, Uro, the one ring and Forth Eorlingas in control decks. There are only a few viable builds right now, because
new threats are really powerful, impactful and they are cheap, so relying on drawing the right answer at the right time isn't as 
appealing as before. New cards like One ring, Lorien revealed and Forth eorlingas might help control be a reasonable deck 
in the metagame.<br>
<a href="https://www.mtgtop8.com/event?e=47323&d=549709&f=LE" target="_blank">Jeskai control</a>
Jeskai is not that well positioned right now, but a lot of people still play it, because it's fun and also not so expensive 
in paper. The deck is built around Narset, parter of veils. The card is really powerful, because it denies your opponent's 
brainstorm and ponder. You have 0 creatures in the deck, so when you activate her ability, you can often choose from 3 cards
to pick, which is really powerful. There are only a few win conditions in the deck, but they can easily kill on it's own and fast.
2 copies of Forth Eorlingas is more than enough to kill your opponent, Comet also helps. Often your opponent just scoops when you
cast Day's Undoing with Narset on board. 1 more important thing with this deck is, that you can play a reasonable game with only
basic lands. That means you don't have to worry about your opponent's wasteland and you can play cards like blood moon or ruination <br>
<a href="https://www.mtgtop8.com/event?e=48699&d=558850&f=LE" target="_blank">4cc</a>
4 color control is probably the strongest control deck in legacy right now. Unlike Jeskai, this deck can afford to play incredibly 
powerful card, the one ring, because of the lifegain from Uro. One ring is just broken in this deck, when you resolve it, it's often
hard to lose. Also because of your mana base, you can play Leyline Binding instead of Prismatic ending. Flash is really good ability!
The multicolored mana base has a significant downside, you become vulnerable to wasteland and blood moon, so you can easily lose
a lot of games due to mana screw. There are a lot of variations of 4 color control. Some of them play Up the beanstalk, some of them play Yorion as their companion,
some of them play green sun's zenith and some toolbox creatures. it's really hard to say which version is best.<br> <br>
Control doesn't have many favored or unfavored match ups, so with tight play, you might just defeat everyone! But usually, 
you cannot play a game perfectly and even the tiniest mistake can cost you a game. Another problem, especially in paper magic 
is finishing your round in time. You need to play fast and if you feel like your opponent is stalling, don't hesitate to call a judge,
you really don't want to draw any match in a big tournament. <br><br>
<h2>Non blue control</h2>
In legacy, there are also some non blue control decks! <br>
<a href="https://www.mtgtop8.com/event?e=48734&d=559094&f=LE" target="_blank">Lands</a>
Lands is a control deck based on, well, lands. The deck is usually green and then 1, in some cases 2 colors. 
Mox diamond and exploration help you to develop your gameplan quicker, while Crop rotation and Life from the loam help you 
find the lands you need. Usually you look for a hand that can produce a fast marit lage or urza's saga tokens, or hands
with crop rotation and especially life from the loam, engine of the deck. Games with lands often go very long because one of your
win conditions is wasteland locking your opponent, which can take some time. Holding back creatures with tabernacle and maze of ith
can also take some time. <br>
<a href="https://www.mtgtop8.com/event?e=48699&d=558849&f=LE" target="_blank">Cradle control</a>
This is very different control deck than the rest, because it's based mainly on creatures. You are looking to put a bunch of 
cheap creatures into play so your gaea's cradle, which you can find with elvish reclaimer, produces a lot of mana. With the 
mana, you can activate ability of Fiend Artisan or cast green sun's zenith to find any creature you want. Natural order for 
craterhoof behemoth is how most of the games end. Grist is really powerful card in this deck, because your fiend artisan and 
green sun's zenith can find it.
